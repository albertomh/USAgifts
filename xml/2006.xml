          <SUBJECT>Office of Protocol; Gifts to Federal Employees From Foreign Government Sources Reported to Employing Agencies in Calendar Year 2006 </SUBJECT>
          <P>The Department of State submits the following comprehensive listing of the statements which, as required by law, Federal employees filed with their employing agencies during calendar year 2006 concerning gifts received from foreign government sources. The compilation includes reports of both tangible gifts and gifts of travel or travel expenses of more than minimal value, as defined by statute. Also, included are gifts received in previous years including 3 gifts in 1999, 2 gifts in 2000, 1 gift in 2001, 9 gifts in 2002, 3 gifts in 2003, 13 gifts in 2004 and 28 gifts in 2005. These latter gifts and expenses are being reported in 2006 as the Office of Protocol, Department of State, did not receive the relevant information to include them in earlier reports. </P>
