Also included are gifts received in previous years including one gift in 2007, five gifts in 2008, ten gifts in 2009, and six gifts with unknown dates. These latter gifts are being reported in 2011 as the Office of the Chief of Protocol, Department of State, did not receive the relevant information to include them in earlier reports.</P>

              <ENT>TRAVEL: Attended the 1st International Sports Security Conference (ISSC). Sponsored participation was a direct result of Mr. Matthew's work in the SERRI-funded Sport-Evac project. The ISSC was a major international initiative aimed at assembling key decision makers to shape the international agenda on sports integrity and security, while enhancing global cooperation. The event offered delegates not only thorough debate but also an opportunity to network with international counterparts. The conference was in Doha, Qatar, on 9th and 10th March 2011 and was limited to a select delegation of 150 figures, all of whom were personally invited by the organizers and come from the world of Sport and Security. This was a seminal site visit in an international forum and demonstrated the international flavor of the world class research DHS S&amp;T is doing. Participation provided an excellent opportunity to forge valuable partnerships. Rec'd—1/31/2011. Est. Value—$8,186.00</ENT>

Mr. Brooks also received $50 per day for dinner, $30 each way to/from the airport in both the US and Chile, and $140 to pay for the reciprocity fee charged to US citizens entering Chile—all totaling $410.
