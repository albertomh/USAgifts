            <P>The Department of State submits the following comprehensive listing of the statements which, as required by law, Federal employees filed with their employing agencies during calendar year 2007 concerning gifts received from foreign government sources. The compilation includes reports of both tangible gifts and gifts of travel or travel expenses of more than minimal value, as defined by statute. Also included are gifts received in previous years including 2 gifts in 2002, 5 gifts in 2005 and 17 gifts in 2006. These latter gifts and expenses are being reported in 2007 as the Office of the Chief of Protocol, Department of State, did not receive the relevant information to include them in earlier reports.</P>
