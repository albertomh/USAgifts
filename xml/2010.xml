              <ENT>TRAVEL: Hotel (11nights)—$2250.00; Meals, local transportation, and misc expenses (13 days)—$1746.00. Invitational travel—Travel dates: 9/19/2010 to 10/1/2010 for Rome, Italy. Dr. Dellarco attended the Joint Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR) as an internationally recognized scientific expert in pesticide risk assessment. The JMPR is administered jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO). JMPR, which consists of the FAO Panel of Experts on Pesticide Residues in Food and the Environment and the WHO Core Assessment Group, is a long standing process under the United Nations. During the Meetings, the FAO and WHO Panel of Experts is responsible for reviewing the toxicology, metabolism, environmental fate, use patterns, residue and analytical aspects of the pesticides under consideration to determine if pesticide residue values will be at a safe dietary intake level for the various populations of the world. The JMPR dietary risk assessments are used to determine the proposed maximum residue limits (i.e., levels of pesticide residue that may be tolerated on food commodities in international trade). Thus, JMPR serves as a scientific advisory body to the Codex Alimentarius Commission. Advice to the Codex Alimentarius Commission on pesticides is provided through the Codex Committee on Pesticide Residues (CCPR). The JMPR provides for an exchange of information with colleagues from around the world. More importantly, it provides an avenue for the US to influence policy and to input into the technical reviews that ultimately result in international standards for food in trade. Dr. Vicki Dellarco was invited to be both a WHO reviewer and to serve as rapporteur of the meeting. Rec'd—9/19/2010-10/1/2010 Est. Value—$3,996.00</ENT>

Traveler is an expert on the ToxCast data, database, statistical approaches and results from the ToxCast program. The traveler is one of the project leaders for the EPA ToxCast program which is implementing the approaches to using mode of action (MOA) analysis. He has developed many of the methods the EPA is using to analyze the ToxCast data and to make use of that data for prioritization of thousands of environmental chemicals for testing. Furthermore, he has led the effort to develop the ACToR database (Aggregated Computational Toxicology Resource) which is the overall repository for related, public data being used in the EPA's screening and prioritization efforts. This data is directly used in current exploratory MOA analyses being carried out by EPA/ORD. He has been invited to this workshop to discuss how the ToxCast program can be used to improve MOA analysis. The traveller will learn about current expert opinion on performing MOA analysis being used by other governments as part of their chemical risk assessment activities, and will have a chance to contribute EPA views on this subject.

Total amount to be directly reimbursed is $668 (Canadian dollars) or approximately $651 (US dollars). The Existing Substances Risk Assessment Bureau, Safe Environments Directorate of Health Canada is holding a 2-day meeting focusing on the use of neurotoxicity and developmental neurotoxicity data in risk assessment. Increased consistency in evaluating and using neurotoxicity data in risk assessments for environmental chemicals will enhance US and EPA goals in effectively regulating environmental chemicals to protect the public health. In addition, the focus on developmental neurotoxicty data is consistent with EPA goals in protecting children and other susceptible populations. Participation in this meeting will enhance EPA/NCEA's knowledge about the ways these data are used in international risk assessment, and promote consistent data interpretation across international organizations. Dr. Raffaele was invited to present lectures to Health Canada staff, over a two day. Her lectures involved the interpretation and use of neurotoxicity and developmental neurotoxicity data in risk assessment of environmental chemicals. Rec'd—9/7/2010-9/10/2010. Est.

Wood Setzer, Ph.D., a biostatistician who has been involved in dose-response analyses for Agency risk assessments. His work has also been addressing issues of applications of statistical methods to PBPK models. The traveler is recognized as an international expert in the area of uncertainty analysis in health effects hazard assessment, and has advised Agency Program Offices, WHO and European Food Safety Agency activities in this area. Dr. Setzer has been invited to serve as a WHO Temporary Advisor for the meeting “Characterizing and Communicating Uncertainty and Variability in Hazard Assessment“, held at RIVM in Bilthoven, Netherlands. The traveler organized and chaired the first in a series of three workshops on the use of PBPK models in risk assessment, of which this is the third, and participated in the second workshop. Dr. Setzer will confer with other world experts in this area to evaluate proposed WHO/IPCS guidance in the use of PBPK models in risk assessment, and area of direct interest for the Agency. While in the Netherlands the traveler will present on the ToxCast progress and then meet with Dr. Slob (RIVM) to collaborate on a manuscript about model uncertainty in dose-response assessment. The Agency has an interest in maintaining communication with world partners in the area of hazard assessment. In this case, the Agency both influences decisions that will affect the ways hazard assessments are carried out and interpreted, and benefits from points of view coming from other contexts. Also, the Agency will benefit from having shared ideas with other experts in this area, and in having its input heard in the proposed guidance. Rec'd—9/14/2010—9/18/2010. Est. Value—$1,350.00</ENT>

              <ENT>TRAVEL: Invitational travel to Rome, Italy—Travel dates: 9/19/2010 to 10/2/2010. Hotel (12 nights)—$2,291.00. Meals, local transportation, and misc expenses (C2514 days)—$2,042.00. Dr. Shah attended the Joint Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR) as an internationally recognized scientific expert in pesticide risk assessment. The JMPR is administered jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO). JMPR, which consists of the FAO Panel of Experts on Pesticide Residues in Food and the Environment and the WHO Core Assessment Group, is a long standing process under the United Nations. During the Meetings, the FAO and WHO Panel of Experts is responsible for reviewing the toxicology, metabolism, environmental fate, use patterns, residue and analytical aspects of the pesticides under consideration to determine if pesticide residue values will be at a safe dietary intake level for the various populations of the world. The JMPR dietary risk assessments are used to determine the proposed maximum residue limits (i.e., levels of pesticide residue that may be tolerated on food commodities in international trade). Thus, JMPR serves as a scientific advisory body to the Codex Alimentarius Commission. Advice to the Codex Alimentarius Commission on pesticides is provided through the Codex Committee on Pesticide Residues (CCPR). The JMPR provides for an exchange of information with colleagues from around the world. More importantly, it provides an avenue for the US to influence policy and to input into the technical reviews that ultimately result in international standards for food in trade. Dr. P.V. Shah was invited to be a temporary advisor to the JMPR during the meeting. Dr. Shah prepared a toxicological monograph on Tebuconazole and Cyproconazole for presentation at the meeting. Based on Dr. Shah's assessments, committee established the acceptable daily intake for cyproconazole and tebuconazole. Rec'd—9/19/2010 to 10/2/2010. Est. Value—$4,333.00</ENT>

              <ENT>TRAVEL: On this 3-month detail to the OECD Climate Change, Biodiversity, and Development Division in Paris, France, the work was to systematically compare policy approaches to address competitiveness and leakage under climate change policy. Travel and living expenses in the amount of approximately $10,550 was paid by OECD. Bella Tonkonogy served on detail to the OECD Climate Change, Biodiversity, and Development Division in the Environment Directorate. The outcome was a report or policy brief for circulation at the UNFCCC meeting in Cancun in December 2010. EPA benefits from participation in this detail by interacting with experts from OECD and member countries in climate policy and competitiveness, advancing dialogue on these topics, and affirming and improving EPA's expertise in this arena. Coordinated international efforts, particularly on emission leakage, led to greater environmental benefits at lower cost. Rec'd—9/18/2010—1/2/2011. Est. Value—$10,550.00</ENT>
